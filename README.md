# App:

A Facebook event-app clone. Built with React, Redux, Reach Router & Parcel.

Currently "API calls" are being mocked by using localstorage. My intention is to eventually set up a small server to handle GET & POST requests.

Features:

-   Log in & out of APp
-   View upcomming events on the "My Events" page
-   Edit existing upcomming events
-   create new events via the "New Events" page
    -   Events inclue the name of the event, location, start & end date & time, and a list of people to invite

# TODO:

New Pages/Features:

-   Friends -> allow users to accept event invitations or invite their friends to sign up for app
-   Settings -> allow users to edit their information

Backend:

-   determine what DB / Server-side language to use
-   Write API

Non-MVP / new features:

-   Implement Google Places autocomplete
-   add a picture to event
-   profile picture / advanced settings
-   Be able to view past events
